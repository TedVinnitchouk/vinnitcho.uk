    <p>
      I am a technologist, but I don't think we have found the equilibirum of technological innovation yet. I believe that technology is the solution to most of the worlds problems, but also the root cause for most of the worlds problems.

      I am currently an investor at White Star Capital based in NYC. I graduated Yale Univesrity in 2024 and grew up in Toronto. For most of my life I was a competitive fencer and was ranked 7th in the world for U19 at one point.

      Throughout my life I have grown to dislike the status quo and tend to question most norms and institutions. I am naturally optimistic and believe humanity is still a long way from reaching its full potential.
