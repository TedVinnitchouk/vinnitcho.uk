    <p class="page-text">
      I am a technologist. I don't think we have found the equilibrium of technological innovation yet. I believe that technology has been the solution to most of the world's problems, but also the root cause for most of the world's problems.

      I am currently an earaly-stage technology investor at White Star Capital based in NYC. I graduated from Yale University in 2024 and grew up in Toronto. For most of my life I was a competitive fencer and was ranked 7th in the world for U19 at one point. I am extremely competitive. I don't see a point in doing something if you don't plan on being the best in the world at it.

      I have grown to dislike the status quo and tend to question most norms and institutions. I am naturally optimistic and believe humanity is still a long way from reaching its full potential. I believe technology will play a pivotal role in humanity reaching its full potential. I always bet on the underdog. I believe the US is the greatest country on earth.
